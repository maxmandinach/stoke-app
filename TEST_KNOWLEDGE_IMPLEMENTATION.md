- Real-time calculation of content mastery percentages

### ✅ **6. Memory Waves Design Implementation**

**Visual Design Elements:**
- **Concentric circles** for progress indicators showing knowledge rippling outward
- **Calm color transitions** encouraging honest self-reflection
- **Ripple effects** for response feedback with appropriate colors (emerald/amber)
- **Smooth animations** with 44px+ touch targets for accessibility
- **Non-judgmental color scheme** avoiding red/failure associations

**Animation System:**
- **Memory Waves progress indicator** showing session completion
- **Response feedback overlays** with scale-in animations
- **Question transitions** with subtle timing and easing
- **Loading states** with ripple animations and encouraging messaging
- **Completion celebrations** with progressive disclosure of results

### ✅ **7. Accessibility & Performance**

**Accessibility Features:**
- **44px minimum touch targets** for all interactive elements
- **ARIA labels** and semantic HTML structure
- **Keyboard navigation** support for all interactions
- **Reduced motion** preferences respected with CSS media queries
- **High contrast** color combinations for text readability

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **Efficient question selection** with O(n log n) sorting algorithms
- **Minimal re-renders** with React useCallback and useMemo
- **Lazy loading** of non-critical session components
- **Database query optimization** with indexed fields for quick lookups
- **Memory management** with proper cleanup and state management
