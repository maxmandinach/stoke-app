# Stoke: Product One-Pager

## Design Principles

### 1. Mindful Utility Over Gamification
Stoke serves as an antidote to attention-fragmenting apps. We prioritize depth of understanding over engagement metrics, avoiding dark patterns and dopamine-driven features. The app functions as a calm utility that respects users' cognitive space.

### 2. AI Assistance with Human Agency
We leverage AI to reduce cognitive burden while preserving user control. The system does the heavy lifting of processing content, but users maintain final say on what's important. Technology serves human judgment rather than replacing it.

### 3. Respect for Attention
Our interface features clean design with adequate white space, meaningful friction where appropriate, and no infinite scrolls or autoplay features. We make deliberate choices about notifications and interruptions, prioritizing the user's focus.

### 4. Connection Over Collection
We emphasize the relationships between pieces of knowledge rather than mere accumulation. The app helps users build a personal knowledge graph that reveals patterns and insights across different content sources.

### 5. Measurable Growth
We provide clear, non-competitive metrics focused on understanding and application. Progress is measured by depth of knowledge integration, not streaks or points.

## User Journey

### 1. Discovery & Selection
- User browses pre-loaded podcast library organized by topics
- User selects interesting episodes to add to their personal library
- User can also submit their own transcript or YouTube link
- System prepares content for processing

### 2. Intelligent Processing
- System processes transcript using Claude 3.7
- AI generates summaries and identifies key concepts and insights
- System tags content with relevant topics for organization
- Content is stored with appropriate metadata for retrieval

### 3. Review & Refinement
- User reviews AI-generated insights and summaries
- User makes minimal adjustments if needed
- System schedules initial review sessions for individual insights

### 4. Retention Through Practice
- System generates various question types for each key insight
- SuperMemo SM-2 algorithm schedules reviews at the insight level
- User completes brief review sessions with varied question formats
- System adjusts future scheduling based on demonstrated retention

### 5. Connection Building
- System suggests relationships between content pieces
- User discovers unexpected connections between topics
- Topic-based organization helps build mental models
- User can search across all saved content to find relevant insights

### 6. Progress Tracking
- User sees retention metrics for different topics
- System provides simple analytics on learning progress
- User can adjust review frequency based on priorities
