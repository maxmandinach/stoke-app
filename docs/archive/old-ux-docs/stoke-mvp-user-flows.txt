# Stoke MVP: User Flows

## Flow 1: Content Discovery & Addition (Curated Library → Content Library)

```
[Curated Library Page] → [Episode Selection] → [Confirm Addition] → [Processing Status] → [Content Library]
```

**Step 1: Curated Library Browse (Discovery Page)**
- User views curated podcast library organized by topics
- Content displays as cards with title, podcast name, duration, and topic tags
- User can filter by topic or search for specific content
- Interface loads with skeleton placeholders featuring Memory Waves concentric patterns while content fetches
- Header displays Memory Waves logo with "Discover" title following brand design language

**Step 2: Episode Selection**
- User taps episode card to view detailed preview modal
- Preview shows full description, key topics, and estimated processing time
- **Pre-processing notice**: User informed that content will be processed once for all users
- Clear add/cancel actions available

**Step 3: Confirm Addition** 
- User confirms adding episode to personal library
- System immediately shows processing status
- User redirected to Processing Status page
- **Enhanced AI processing begins**: One-time generation of summaries (quick/full) and question pool (10-15 per hour)

**Step 4: Return to Content Library**
- After processing completes, user navigates back to Content Library (home)
- New content appears in personal library with all variants ready for any session type
- Content Library remains the primary hub for ongoing activity

### Key Considerations
- **Shared content model**: First user to add an episode triggers processing for all future users
- **Already processed content**: If episode exists, immediate addition to user's library
- Handle network failures gracefully with offline queuing
- Prevent duplicate additions with clear "already added" states
- Seamless flow back to Content Library after addition

## Flow 2: Content Addition Validation (Simplified)

```
[Processing Complete] → [Content Available] → [Add to Library]
```

**Step 1: Processing Complete Notification**
- User receives notification that content processing is finished
- **No validation step required**: Pre-processed content is standardized and consistent
- Content immediately available for all session types

**Step 2: Automatic Library Integration**
- Content automatically added to user's library in "Available" state
- **Ready for immediate use**: All summaries and questions pre-generated
- User can begin any session type without additional processing

### Key Considerations
- **Eliminate validation friction**: Standardized AI processing removes need for user review
- **Immediate availability**: Content ready for Read Summaries, Test Knowledge, or Both sessions
- **Consistent experience**: All users see identical content quality and structure

## Flow 3: Review Session Experience (Two-Step Process)

```
[Content Library] → [Content Selection] → [Session Configuration] → [Session Experience] → [Return to Library]
```

### Step 1: Content Selection Interface

- **Selection persistence**: State maintained despite scrolling and navigation

**Advanced Filtering Options:**
- **Topic/Category filters**: Filter by one or multiple topics with smart deduplication
- **Multi-topic episodes**: Episodes spanning multiple selected topics appear once with all relevant topics listed
- **"Select All" functionality**: When filtered by topic, option to select all visible episodes
- **Clear filters**: Easy reset to show all content

**Selection State Management:**
- Visual indicators for selected episodes with Memory Waves design language
- Persistent selection count throughout the interface
- Easy deselection with visual feedback
- Smart handling of episodes that appear under multiple filtered topics

### Step 2: Session Configuration

**Session Type Selection:**
- **Read Summaries**: Review quick or full summaries without interaction
- **Test Knowledge**: Answer questions from pre-generated pools with binary feedback
- **Both**: Read all summaries first, then answer mixed questions from all selected content

**Session Length Configuration:**
- **Quick (1-3 minutes)**: Optimized for brief review sessions
- **Medium (3-5 minutes)**: Balanced content exposure
- **Extended (5-15 minutes)**: Comprehensive review depending on content volume
- **Dynamic time estimates**: Updates based on selected content and session type

**Content Summary Display:**
- Shows selected episode count and total estimated duration
- Preview of session structure (e.g., "5 summaries, then 12 questions")
- Option to return to content selection to modify choices

### Step 3: Session Experience Implementation

#### Read Summaries Sessions
- **Summary type selection**: User chooses quick (4 bullet points/hour) or full (2 paragraphs/hour)
- **Sequential presentation**: One summary at a time with clean, readable formatting
- **Progress indication**: "Summary 2 of 5" with Memory Waves circular progress
- **No interaction required**: Simple "Next" navigation between summaries
- **Optional transition**: "Continue to Test Knowledge" if user selected "Both"

#### Test Knowledge Sessions
- **Random question selection**: Questions pulled randomly from pre-generated pools
- **Binary feedback system**: Only "Got it" vs "Revisit" responses
- **No text input**: Eliminates answer validation complexity
- **Mixed content presentation**: Questions from all selected episodes randomized together
- **Weighted allocation**: Longer content gets proportionally more questions
- **Progress tracking**: "Question 8 of 15" with session-wide progress indication

#### Both Sessions (Sequential Structure)
- **Phase 1**: Present all summaries from selected content first
- **Transition phase**: Clear indication moving from summaries to questions
- **Phase 2**: Mixed randomized questions from all selected content
- **Unified progress**: Overall session progress across both phases

### Step 4: Individual Question Experience

**Question Presentation:**
- **Clean interface**: One question at a time following Memory Waves aesthetic principles
- **Binary response options**: Large, touch-friendly "Got it" and "Revisit" buttons
- **No answer validation**: Questions designed for self-assessment
- **Immediate progression**: Instant advance to next question after response
- **Auto-save progress**: Prevent data loss during session interruptions

**Spaced Repetition Integration:**
- **Individual scheduling**: Each user's response affects their personal spaced repetition schedule
- **Algorithm updates**: SuperMemo SM-2 adjustments based on "Got it" vs "Revisit" responses
- **Shared content, individual progress**: Same questions for all users, personalized scheduling

### Step 5: Session Completion & Return

**Session Summary:**
- **Performance overview**: Simple metrics without competitive elements
- **Content covered**: Summary of episodes and question count completed
- **Next session guidance**: Suggested timeframe for next review based on performance
- **No detailed breakdown**: Avoid overwhelming users with granular statistics

**Return to Content Library:**
- All progress automatically saved to user's individual spaced repetition schedule
- Updated content states reflecting recent review activity
- Clear path to start new session or adjust library content
- Content Library remains central hub for all activity

### Key Considerations
- **Two-step process**: Clear separation between content selection and session configuration
- **Selection state persistence**: Maintain user choices throughout the flow
- **Multi-topic smart handling**: Avoid duplicate episode listings in filtered views
- **Random question mixing**: Questions from multiple episodes randomized together
- **Individual progress on shared content**: Personal spaced repetition schedules for consistent questions
- **Simplified feedback**: Binary responses eliminate complexity while maintaining effectiveness
