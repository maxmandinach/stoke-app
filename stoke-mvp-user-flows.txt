# Stoke MVP: User Flows

## Flow 1: Content Discovery & Addition (Curated Library → Content Library)

```
[Curated Library Page] → [Episode Selection] → [Confirm Addition] → [Processing Status] → [Content Library]
```

**Step 1: Curated Library Browse (Discovery Page)**
- User views curated podcast library organized by topics
- Content displays as cards with title, podcast name, duration, and topic tags
- User can filter by topic or search for specific content
- Interface loads with skeleton placeholders while content fetches

**Step 2: Episode Selection**
- User taps episode card to view detailed preview modal
- Preview shows full description, key topics, and estimated number of insights
- Processing time estimate displayed (optimized for speed)
- Clear add/cancel actions available

**Step 3: Confirm Addition** 
- User confirms adding episode to personal library
- System immediately shows processing status
- User redirected to Processing Status page
- Background AI processing begins automatically

**Step 4: Return to Content Library**
- After processing completes, user navigates back to Content Library (home)
- New content appears in personal library ready for review
- Content Library remains the primary hub for ongoing activity

### Key Considerations
- Curated Library is discovery-focused, not the primary landing page
- Handle network failures gracefully with offline queuing
- Prevent duplicate additions with clear "already added" states
- Seamless flow back to Content Library after addition

## Flow 2: Content Approval & Library Addition

```
[Processing Complete] → [Quick Review] → [Accept/Defer Decision] → [Add to Library]
```

**Step 1: Processing Complete Notification**
- User receives notification that content processing is finished
- Can view results immediately or return to them later from library
- Processing continues in background if user navigates away

**Step 2: Quick Content Review (30 seconds)**
- User scans AI-generated summary and key insights in clean, scannable format
- Simple validation: "Looks good" or "Not quite right" options
- If "Not quite right" → optional brief feedback, but content still proceeds to library
- No detailed editing or extensive validation required

**Step 3: Immediate Action Decision**
- Two clear options: "Start reviewing this now" or "Save for later"
- Default selection: "Save for later" to reduce pressure
- Both options add content to user's library with "Active" status
- Choosing "Start reviewing this now" immediately begins single-episode review session

**Step 4: Library Integration**
- Content automatically added to library in "Active" state
- Available for future review sessions and selection
- User can access and review at any time from library interface

### Key Considerations
- Minimize friction between processing completion and library addition
- Build trust through quick, non-judgmental validation process
- Default to defer immediate review to reduce cognitive pressure
- Ensure all processed content reaches the library regardless of validation feedback

## Flow 3: Review Session Experience (Primary Content Library Flow)

```
[Content Library Landing] → [Content Selection] → [Start Review] → [Mixed Session] → [Return to Library]
```

**Step 1: Content Library Landing Page**
- User arrives at Content Library as primary app entry point
- Views personal collection of processed content with status indicators
- Checkbox selection UX with "Select All/None" functionality
- Start Review button dynamically updates: "Start Review" vs "Start Review (3 episodes)"

**Step 2: Review Session Initialization**
- **With Selection**: Review session includes insights only from selected episodes
- **No Selection**: Auto-curated session from last 30 days of active content (excluding dismissed)
- **Fallback**: If insufficient content in 30 days, expand timeframe to 6 months
- Session shows total question count: "Question 5 of 23"

**Step 3: Mixed Content Review Experience**
- Insights from multiple episodes randomly interweaved throughout session
- Various question types: recall, recognition, application
- Clean, distraction-free interface with one question at a time
- Progress indicator shows overall session progress, not episode breakdown
- Auto-save progress to prevent data loss

**Step 4: Individual Content Feedback**
- After each question, user can provide insight-level feedback:
  - "Got it!" → Normal spaced repetition progression
  - "Still working on this one" → Extends review frequency, stays prominent
  - "Don't show me this again" → Dismisses insight from future sessions
- Episode-level dismissal available: removes all remaining questions from that episode
- Mid-session dismissal immediately skips to next episode's content

**Step 5: Return to Content Library**
- Summary of session performance without competitive metrics
- All feedback automatically applied to future session curation
- Clear indication of when next review session might be beneficial
- Return to Content Library (home) with updated content states

### Key Considerations
- Content Library serves as both landing page and post-session destination
- Random interweaving prevents predictable patterns and enhances learning
- Multi-level dismissal gives users granular control over their experience
- Auto-curation reduces decision fatigue while respecting user preferences

## Flow 4: Manual Content Addition (Content Library → Manual Add → Content Library)

```
[Content Library] → [Add Content Page] → [Input Source] → [Process Upload] → [Content Library]
```

**Step 1: Manual Addition Access**
- User initiates manual content addition from Content Library
- Clear entry point (+ button or "Add Content" action)
- Navigation to dedicated Manual Add Content page

**Step 2: Content Input Options**
- User chooses between YouTube link or transcript file upload
- Clear interface with tabs or buttons for each option type
- Input validation provides immediate feedback on URL format or file type
- Helper text explains supported formats and requirements

**Step 3: Content Processing**
- **YouTube Option**: User pastes URL, system extracts transcript automatically
- **Transcript Upload**: User selects file from device, validates format and size
- Processing status shows extraction progress and any potential issues
- Error handling for invalid URLs, missing transcripts, or unsupported formats

**Step 4: Content Preview & Metadata**
- User reviews extracted content with auto-detected title and topics
- Option to edit title, description, and add custom topic tags
- Preview shows word count and estimated processing time
- Clear indication of what will happen when processing begins

**Step 5: Return to Content Library**
- User confirms addition and processing begins
- Navigation back to Content Library (home) where new content will appear
- Processing continues in background with status available from Content Library
- Success confirmation with next steps clearly communicated

### Key Considerations
- Manual addition flows always return to Content Library as the central hub
- Handle YouTube API limitations and provide alternative solutions
- Implement file size limits with clear guidance for large transcripts
- Provide content quality feedback before processing begins
